# 🏄‍♂️ Hi, I'm Shivansh
Backend engineer with a love for clean architecture, systems thinking, and making things *actually* scale.  
I enjoy backend engineering, cloud fundamentals, automating workflows, and messing with agentic AI on the side.


# 🧘‍♂️ The Zen of Shivansh
10 principles I _try_ to build and think with (inspired by The Zen of Python):

1. **Think in systems, build with intention.**  
   Great engineering starts long before the first line of code.

2. **Start small, move fast, evolve constantly.**  
   Momentum beats perfection on every timeline.

3. **If you don’t understand it deeply, you don’t use it yet.**  
   Knowledge compounds; shortcuts don’t.

4. **Write code that future-you will thank you for.**  
   Clarity today is freedom tomorrow.

5. **When stuck, reduce the problem until it becomes obvious.**  
   Simplicity is the ultimate unlock.

6. **Automate anything that annoys you twice.**  
   Your efficiency is built from your impatience.

7. **Let principles guide you; let tools serve you.**  
   Foundations stay; frameworks fade.

8. **Consistency beats intensity.**  
   Skill is built by rhythm, not bursts.

9. **Fix root causes, not symptoms.**  
   Stability is born from understanding, not patchwork.

10. **Curiosity is your edge; protect it fiercely.**  
    In the age of AI, your mind is the differentiator.
